        <h1>What is Canada?</h1>
        <p>Canada is probably one of the first countries that you can remember when thinking about a snowy forest in the mountains. With everything from mountains to moose, Canada's nature is truely a sight to see. But even though the nature itself is pretty exclusive to Canada, that's not the only thing that makes it special. Because Canada is a country which has welcomed people from across the world, and with these people come various coutures and nationalities. This means that Canada not only has a ton of cool places and sights to see, but that it also has a wide variety of cultures and traditions. There are 140 different language speakers in Toronto alone, and almost half of the population in Canada are outsiders. Culture that they got from outside are: St. Patrick's Day and Labor Day are weekends.</p>

        <h2>Sports in Canada</h2>
        <p>Canada, much like a lot of other countries in the world, have a national sport that is a part of their culture. The sport is called ice hockey, and it was created in Canada way back in 1875. The term hockey is actually a family of sports that involves sticks and goals, where a team must score goals by shooting an object with their stick into a goal. The sport that is specific to Canada though is ice hockey and is on a surface level just hockey except it’s on ice and you shoot a puck to score. Ice hockey is a large part of Canadian culture to the point where there are indoor and outdoor ice hockey rinks in almost every single community in the country so that the people can play it whenever they feel like it!</p>
        <h2>Food!</h2>
        <p>Maple syrup is a very popular syrup that comes from Canada. According to statistics, 71% of the world’s maple syrup comes from Canada. But even though maple syrup comes from Canada, that’s not the only reason why it’s a part of Canadian culture. Maple syrup has a long history that dates back to the country’s indigenous people. They taught the Canadian settlers to boil sap from maple trees to then make maple syrup. Not only is it a part of Canadian culture, but it is also a part of their economy. Canada produced a whopping 14.29 million gallons of maple syrup in 2020, which is the most they’ve ever made. A lot of this is exported to other countries, with their main importer being America.</p>

        <p>Another popular food other than maple syrup is a dish called poutine. Poutine is a mix of french fries and cheese curds with gravy to top it off. It’s a popular meal in Canada, but it’s also made into a fast food dish in many parts of the country. It originated in Quebec, which is the largest of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. There are many variations of poutine, but they are generally looked down on compared to the real deal, for example, a variation where you remove the cheese. This variation is still called poutine for most, but for some of the Quebecs, it’s a completely different food called “frite sauce” which surprisingly just means french fries with gravy.</p>
        <h2>Visual arts</h2>
        <p>Canada has a history of handicrafts and sculptures that have existed since the earliest of Canadian history, but even though this is the case scholars and museums only started to notice them around the 20th century. Such art pieces as stone carvings from the Inuits or the totem-pole carvings from Northwest Coast Indigenous people. The settlers also had their own art and painting styles that had clear American and European influences, but some of them wanted to create a distinctly Canadian painting style to add to their culture. This painting style was very inspired by the landscape of Canada, which includes many mountains, rivers and forests.</p></p>

        <h2>Beaver tails</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Canadians don't actually eat beaver tails. Instead it's celebrated with giant deep fried sweet delicacies. They're made of a dough that is long and flat, and then deep fried and served in a sleeve of paper. After that, they add a mix of sugar and cinnamon sprinkles on the top. Other sweet stuff that you can find are maple cream, chocolate spread and cookies. This is the best ideal meal after spending time on a pond or skating rink because this tradition is more usual in the winter.
